# T450-s-Opencore-0.6.2-Intel-wifi
It supports Native Intel wifi and bluetooth so no wifi card swap is needed.

 Whats works: Graphic card, CPU POWER MANAGMENT (SSDT FROM I5 5300u), Audio, SD CARD READER, INTEL WIFI AND BLUETOOTH,
 Brightness adjustment, 
 
 Whats not working properly: Hibernation (maybe because of the Intel Wifi KEXT)
 
 What you need to do: generate your own SMBIOS for full functionality
